## General Information
- Bike Sharing company boombikes is trying to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. 
- Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. 
- The company wants to know:
-       1.Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
-       2.How well those variables describe the bike demands

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We found out top 8 most significant features by which we can predict the market by near to 80%
- List of features found out to be significant are :
-        1. yr
-        2. temp
-        3. hum
-        4. windspeed
-        5. weathersit_lightsnow
-        6. season_summer
-        7. season_winter
-        8. mnth_sep

- List of finding from the analysis
-   1. We observed that features 'hum', 'windspeed', 'weathersit_lightsnow' are having negative correlation with the target
        which shows that when we have high winds or hihg humidity or snow weather people are less likely to take Bike
	2. Season 'summer' is having very less correlation compared to season 'winter' which could mean people are less likely to use bikes
		in summer than in winter
